🏀 Celtics Fan | 🎨 Fashion & Design | 📸 Photography | 🎵 R&B | ✈️ Travel | 🐾 Boston (My Goldendoodle!)

I'm a graduate student in Applied Business Analytics at Boston University with a background in Finance. This semester, I’ve explored everything from marketing analytics and enterprise risk to data mining and web analytics—developing a toolkit that blends technical depth with business intuition.

When I’m not modeling trends or debugging dashboards, I’m probably sketching fashion designs, watching Boston sports (die hard fan here!), or exploring nature with my best friend, Boston the Goldendoodle!
