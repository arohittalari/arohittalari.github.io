## üè• Project #1 - Laralex Hospital Case Study  
**Type:** Healthcare Operations | Quality Management  
**Tools Used:** P Charts, Shewhart Rules, Confidence Intervals  

**Overview:**  
Conducted a hospital-wide performance review using statistical process control methods. Assessed metrics such as hospital-acquired infections, ED departures, and cesarean section rates against industry benchmarks. Applied Shewhart Rules and P Charts to distinguish between random variation and true process instability.  

**Impact:**  
Identified unstable processes and proposed targeted interventions aligned with Joint Commission accreditation standards. Recommended culture change, union engagement, and statistical training to support Lean Six Sigma implementation.

## üíª Project #3 - IMD Help Desk Optimization  
**Type:** Operations Strategy | Queuing Theory  
**Tools Used:** M/M/s Queuing Model, Scenario Simulation, Arrival & Service Rate Modeling  

**Overview:**  
Partnered on an operations strategy case study to assess two help desk configurations: a segmented system (by issue type) vs. a unified support model. Used queuing theory and simulation modeling to evaluate system efficiency across varying timeframes and customer inflow scenarios.  

**Impact:**  
Determined optimal server configurations based on tradeoffs between average wait times, queue lengths, and resource efficiency. Recommended a hybrid queuing structure calibrated to manage weekly demand fluctuations while minimizing idle time and maintaining service quality.
